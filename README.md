# Best Foot Forward

Best Foot Forward is a React-Redux application that enables the user to create, customise, and coordinate football teams. It was created as part of the technical challenge of Develop Me's Coding Fellowship.

You can find Best Foot Forward live [here](https://vixhez.github.io/best-foot-forward).

## Run Best Foot Forward locally

In the terminal...

1. Navigate to the location that you would like the project to be saved in

2. Run `git clone {git@github.com:vixhez/best-foot-forward.git}`

3. Run `npm install` to install all required packages to your machine

4. Start the app by running `npm start`

5. Head to (http://localhost:3000/) to view the app

## Process and Decisions

### Process

The MVP set by Develop Me was to create a tool that could randomly pick 5-a-side football teams from a list of 10 names. Sticking with Agile methodology, I ensured that this was up and running in the early days of the project.

I continuously utilised GitHub issues as a to-do list in order to keep myself thinking in small increments and to maintain clear project direction. I also hand sketched a wireframe to enable visual direction when building the core logic, in the hope that this would help the project to play out fluidly.

Once the MVP had been fulfilled, I began with my variety of stretch goals, which included logic for skills balancing of teams, visual aspects such as a team kit and pattern picker, and the creation of a support banner during the match using the user's input.

### Decisions

- Utilising ternary statements and conditional rendering to navigate through the app, as opposed to viable alternatives such as routing
- React for components and Redux for state management
- Atomic commits with Git, assisted by GitHub issues to keep progress increments small and specific
- DaFont, FontAwesome and coolors.co to deliver inspiration for styling decisions

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

#### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
