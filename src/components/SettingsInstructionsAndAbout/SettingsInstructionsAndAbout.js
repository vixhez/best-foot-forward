                Begin by choosing the number of players you would like on each team.
                You can then proceed to innovating your very own team name.
                Then, step into the sports boutique to try on different combinations of team kits and designs. Do this by clicking the clothing and pattern icons to mix and match.
                Next, think up a banner message to be held by the team's supporters during the match.
                Do the same for the second team and then click 'Save Settings'.
