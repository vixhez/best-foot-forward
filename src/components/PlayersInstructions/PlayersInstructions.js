                Great designing!
                Now it's time to add the player's names and skill levels.
                The number of player fields provided is based on how many people you previously decided would be on each team.
                Fill out each field and then press 'Confirm Player'.
                You then have the choice to sort your teams randomly, or for fairer teams, based on skill levels.
                If it's all gone horribly wrong, just press restart!
